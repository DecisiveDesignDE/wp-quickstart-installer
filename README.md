# WP Quickstart Installer 🚀

This is an **early version** of a standalone WordPress installer.  
It allows users to easily install WordPress along with their favorite plugins and themes — all from a clean and friendly graphical interface.

## 💡 What It Does

- ✅ Downloads and extracts the latest WordPress version
- ✅ Lets you select popular plugins and themes via checkboxes
- ✅ Automatically downloads the latest versions from wordpress.org
- ✅ Uploads the full setup to your FTP or SFTP server
- ✅ Wraps everything in a simple graphical setup wizard (built with Tkinter)
